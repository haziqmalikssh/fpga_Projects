# FPGA Projects Repository

This repository is a collection of various **Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)** designs. Each distinct project is located in its own directory.

---

## Accessing Designs

To understand, build, and deploy any design, you must consult the individual `README.md` file found within that project's specific folder. This document outlines the project's purpose, the necessary target hardware, and the development tools required for that design.

## General Requirements

To successfully synthesize, implement, and run these projects, you generally need:

* **Development Tool Suite:** Commercial or open-source software such as **Quartus Prime** (for Intel/Altera) or **Vivado** (for Xilinx).
* **Target Hardware:** The specific **FPGA development board** indicated in the project's documentation.
* **HDL Knowledge:** Understanding of **Verilog** or **VHDL** to modify or debug the designs.
